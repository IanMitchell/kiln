# Kiln

This is yet another JavaScript boilerplate. I was having trouble finding one that looked enticing, so I sat down and wrote my own using all the components I was most interested in.

I hope to flesh this out a little more in the future, but we'll see.

## Usage

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Components

1. Babel 6
2. AirBnb ESLint
3. Express
4. Universal React (uses react-router and has hot module replacement)
5. Sass
6. Webpack
8. PostCSS (works alongside / before Sass)
11. Nodemon
12. Socket.IO
